# DSA

This repository contains various Data Structures and Algorithms problems along with my approach to solving them.

The file names follow the problem name and number as listed on LeetCode.

Each code file includes-

* The core idea behind my approach
* Time complexity
* Space complexity
* The actual implementation

Each file is committed with a message that denotes the actual time of upload.

I wanted to upload the solution code exactly when I wrote it on the coding platform. To streamline this workflow, I created a custom automation using Apple Shortcut that can be run from my laptop or Phone. The shortcut takes the problem name and the code i wrote , creates a file, and if needed adds comment using Gemini for better readability. Then the file gets encoded in Base64 . It finally uses GitHub access token to upload file to my GitHub repository , along with a dynamically generated commit message that includes the current timestamp. I assigned a keyboard shortcut so the entire process can be completed by simply pressing **^ + C** on my Mac or using the shortcut on my phone.
